2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algotithmic (Decentralized)
3. Collateral: Exogeneous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC

- calculate health factor function
- set health factor if debt is 0

1. What are invariants/properties

1. Some proper oracle use
1. Writing more tests!
1. Smart contract audit preparedness
